## About The Project

This is a concept DApp that allows users to create contests/elections, add authorized voters, and collect votes. Voting delegation is technically possible using the existing smart contract code, but this feature has not been implimented yet.
This is a two-page concept project that was built using several fameworks and libraries, including but not limited to the Truffle Suite, Ethers, Next, and Tailwind.
The project is meant to showcase how smart contracts may be used manage a voting system in a decentralized manner. This means that, as far as the UI goes, it is still missing some polishing such as loading animations, double-request protection, input validation, and other similar features. These features were deemed unnecessary for the purposes of this concept project. That said, the project still has an aesthetic but simple frontend.
This project and its code were engineered solely by Zaid Allam.

## Getting Started

Getting started is easy. Simply download the repository and run `npm i` in both the `/client` and `/blockchain` directories. Then, open two separate terminals.
In the second terminal, navigate to the blockchain directory and run `truffle migrate`. Once that has completed, run `truffle deploy` and keep note of the Decentraballot contract deployment address. Finally, run `truffle develop`.
In the first terminal, navigate to the client directory. Before running `npm run dev` or `npm run build`, navigate to `./constants.js` and add the address of your instance of the Decentraballot contract.
Finally, once all the above steps have been compeleted, launch your browser and open localhost:3000. You should be all set!
