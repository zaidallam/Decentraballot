## About The Project

This is a concept DApp that allows users to create contests/elections, add authorized voters, and collect votes. Voting delegation is technically possible using the existing smart contract code, but this feature has not been implimented yet.
This is a two-page concept project that was built using several fameworks and libraries, including but not limited to the Truffle Suite, Ethers, Next, and Tailwind.
The project is meant to showcase how smart contracts may be used manage a voting system in a decentralized manner. This means that, as far as the UI goes, it is still missing some polishing such as loading animations, double-request protection, input validation, and other similar features. These features were deemed unnecessary for the purposes of this concept project. That said, the project still has an aesthetic but simple frontend.
This project and its code were engineered solely by Zaid Allam.
